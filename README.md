# Depot `bake-action` GitHub Action

This action implements the same inputs and outputs as the [`docker/bake-action`](https://github.com/docker/bake-action), but uses the [`depot` CLI](https://github.com/depot/cli) to execute the build.

## Setup

The `depot` CLI will need to be available in your workflow, you can use the [`depot/setup-action`](https://github.com/depot/setup-action) to install it:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: depot/setup-action@v1
```

## Usage

This action implements the same inputs and outputs as the [`docker/bake-action`](https://github.com/docker/bake-action). You will need to supply your project ID and Depot authentication information, although both can be inferred from the environment. See below for more details.

### Authentication

This action needs a Depot API token to communicate with your project's builders. You can supply this one of three ways. The third, using OIDC, is the preferred method, but you can also supply a token directly.

1. You can supply a user or project API token via the `token` input:

   ```yaml
   steps:
     - uses: depot/bake-action@v1
       with:
         token: ${{ secrets.DEPOT_TOKEN }}
   ```

2. You can supply a user or project API token via the `DEPOT_TOKEN` environment variable:

   ```yaml
   steps:
     - uses: depot/bake-action@v1
       env:
         DEPOT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DEPOT_TOKEN }}
   ```

3. Depot supports GitHub's [OpenID Connect](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect) tokens via a trust relationship, so your Actions builds can securely authenticate with your Depot projects without any static access tokens. To configure the trust relationship, visit your Depot project settings, then add your repository and desired workflow config to `Trust Relationships`. Then in your workflow, enable the `id-token: write` permission:

   ```yaml
   permissions:
     # allow issuing OIDC tokens for this workflow run
     id-token: write
     # allow at least reading the repo contents, add other permissions if necessary
     contents: read
   steps:
     # no need to provide a DEPOT_TOKEN
     - uses: depot/bake-action@v1
   ```

### Differences from `docker/bake-action`

1. Authentication â€” this action needs to authenticate with a Depot API token to communicate with your project's builders (see above).

2. If you have not configured a `depot.json` file with `depot init`, you can explicitly specify your project ID via the `project` input:

   ```yaml
   steps:
     - uses: depot/bake-action@v1
       with:
         project: abc123xyz
   ```

3. The `builder` input is not supported - this action always runs builds using Depot's hosted builders, if you need to route builds to a local buildx builder, you should use the `docker/build-push-action`.

| `save`           | Boolean | Save the image to the Depot ephemeral registry (for use with the [depot/pull-action](https://github.com/depot/pull-action))                                                    |
